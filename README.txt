PURPOSE OF THIS APPLICATION:
This application is designed to help calculate the amount of change in bills and coins needed for an inputted value (1 cents/pennies are excluded). For example, the calculator given the input 110.85 would calculate that one 100 bill, one 10 bill, one 50 cent coin, one 20 cent coin, one 10 cent coin, and one 5 cent coin are the exact amount of bills and coins needed to match the change.

If you have any questions, please let me know. I hope you enjoy testing out the Android application.
